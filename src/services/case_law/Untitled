A had been taking to Russia 28,500 euros in banknotes, which were considered to be his savings, which had been confiscated from him during an exit check. A had stated that his intention was to return to Finland with the banknotes and spend the funds here. The Supreme Court held that the exception provided for in Article 5i(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, which permitted the export of euro banknotes for the personal use of natural persons travelling to Russia, could not be applied to A’s conduct. Since the principle of legality in criminal law did not prevent A from being held responsible for the conduct, A was found to have committed a regulatory offence.

RL 46 chapter 1 section 1 subsection (506/2015)

Hearing of the case in lower courts
Kymenlaakso District Court judgment 20.4.2023 no. 23/116279

The District Court found it established that A had left Finland for Russia on 2 March 2023 via the Vaalimaa border crossing without declaring anything for customs clearance. At the same time, 28,500 euros in cash, enclosed in an envelope, had been found in the inside pocket of his jacket. The District Court found it established that the origin of the funds in question had been A's salary income, but did not consider it credible that he had kept them with him solely because of his distrust of banks, but rather in order to benefit financially from the funds he had saved in Russia. The issue was not the export of currency for personal use to Russia, as permitted by Article 5i(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 833/2014.

The District Court further held that A could not have been mistaken in believing that exporting currency to Russia had been prohibited under the sanctions regulations, taking into account the extensive coverage of the sanctions in the media, the instructions on the Customs website, and A's several years of experience traveling across the border between Finland and Russia with the various regulations that apply to them. In any case, A should have found out about the regulations that apply to him before crossing the border.

The District Court found A guilty of a regulatory offence and sentenced him to 60 days of suspended imprisonment. In addition, the District Court sentenced A to forfeiture to the state the 28,500 euros seized from him.

The case has been decided by District Judge Jaana Kumpumäki.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal of Eastern Finland, 29 February 2024, no. 24/108897

A appealed to the Court of Appeal, demanding the dismissal of the charges and the claim for forfeiture of funds, and the return of the confiscated money.

The Court of Appeal held, referring to the objectives, structure and different language versions of Article 5i of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and the EU Commission guidelines, that the exception to the export ban on the export of banknotes for personal use contained in the provision had to be interpreted narrowly, so that it did not allow the export of anything other than funds that were necessary to cover the living expenses of a person travelling to Russia and his family members during the trip. The exception in question could not be applied in the case, because A had not indisputably intended to use the funds in his possession to cover the living expenses incurred during the trip, but rather his savings.

The Court of Appeal also held that the principle of legality in criminal law did not prevent A from being held responsible for the proceedings and that he could not be released from criminal liability under Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Criminal Code concerning the error of prohibition. With regard to the error of prohibition, the Court of Appeal drew particular attention to A's long experience with customs formalities at the border between Finland and Russia, the widespread media coverage of the sanctions and the otherwise wide availability of information, and the fact that the failure to declare the money to Customs despite the fact that, according to previous customs regulations, exports of more than 10,000 euros should have been declared to them, supported the perception of a desire to secretly export the money to Russia and a deliberate failure to clarify export restrictions.

The Court of Appeal did not change the outcome of the district court's judgment.

The case was decided by Court of Appeal Counselors Lasse Tamminen and Tiina Pirinen and Assessor Antti Santaranta.

Appeal to the Supreme Court
A was granted leave to appeal under Chapter 30, Section 3, Subsection 2, Paragraph 2 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, limited to the question of whether A had committed a regulatory offence by his conduct.

In his appeal, A demanded that the charge be dismissed.

In its response, the prosecutor demanded that the appeal be dismissed.

The Supreme Court reserved the opportunity for A and the prosecutor to state the possible relevance of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 30 April 2025, ZZ v Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main, C-246/24, EU:C:2025:295, in the case. The parties did not make any statements.

Supreme Court decision
Reasoning

Background of the case and the question posed in the Supreme Court

1. On 2 March 2023, Russian citizen A was leaving Finland for Russia via the Vaalimaa border crossing. During the exit check, 28,500 euros in banknotes were found in his possession, sealed in an envelope in the inside pocket of his jacket. He had not declared the money for customs clearance. According to A, he intended to return to Finland with the funds saved from his salary and use them for living expenses and to purchase an apartment here.

2. The Supreme Court is considering whether A committed a regulatory offence by his actions, taking into account in particular the interpretation of Regulation (EU) 833/2014 and the importance of the principle of legality in criminal law.

Was the issue of permitted or prohibited exports?

3. According to Chapter 46, Section 1, Subsection 1, Paragraph 9 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the commission (506/2015), a person shall be convicted of a regulatory offence if he violates or attempts to violate a regulatory order laid down in regulations issued under Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on the suspension of economic and financial relations with a third country or on the imposition of restrictive measures on natural or legal persons, groups or non-governmental entities falling within the scope of the European Union's common foreign and security policy, or issued pursuant to the said regulations.

4. The Supreme Court finds that the revised provisions of Chapter 46 of the Criminal Code (179/2025) that entered into force on 20 May 2025 do not lead to a more lenient outcome for A than the law in force at the time of the offence. Accordingly, in accordance with Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, the law in force at the time of the offence must be applied in the matter.

5. Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine is one of the regulations referred to in Chapter 46, Section 1, Subsection 1, Point 9 of the Criminal Code. Article 5i of the Regulation (2022/576) provided, at the time of its adoption, the following:

"1. The sale, supply, transfer or export of banknotes denominated in the official currency of any Member State to Russia or to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia, including the Russian authorities and the Central Bank, or for use in Russia, shall be prohibited.

2. The prohibition laid down in paragraph 1 shall not apply to the sale, supply, transfer or export of banknotes denominated in the official currency of any Member State if such sale, supply, transfer or export is intended for:

a) for the personal use of natural persons travelling to Russia or their family members travelling with them; or

b) for the official use of diplomatic and consular missions or international organizations operating in Russia, which enjoy immunity under international law.”

6. A has primarily considered that his conduct has involved an export permitted under Article 5i(2)(a) of the Regulation.

7. The Court of Justice of the European Union has held, on the interpretation of the exception provision on personal use, that the sale, supply, transfer and export of euro banknotes are authorised under that provision only where they are intended to finance the travel and accommodation costs of a person travelling to Russia and of close relatives travelling with him in order to acquire the goods and services which he necessarily needs during his journey and stay in Russia (judgment of 30 April 2025, ZZ v Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main, C - 246/24, EU:C:2025:295, paragraphs 33-34; see also paragraph 26).

8. A has not claimed that he intended to use the money for travel and accommodation expenses incurred in Russia, and the amount of money in question is not otherwise compatible with such a purpose. Accordingly, the Supreme Court, referring to the above-mentioned judgment of the Court of Justice, states that A's conduct cannot be considered as a permitted export within the meaning of Article 5i(2)(a) of the Regulation, but rather meets the characteristics of a regulatory offence, unless the principle of legality in criminal law dictates otherwise.

Criminal legality principle

Starting points for the assessment

9. A has considered that his criminal liability cannot be based on Article 5(i) of Regulation 833/2014, also because its wording does not clearly indicate that his conduct was prohibited.

10. The principle of legality in criminal law is laid down in Section 8 of the Constitution of Finland, Chapter 3, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, Article 49 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 15 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

11. The Supreme Court has, in its established case law (e.g. KKO 2018:49, paragraph 18 and KKO 2025:56, paragraph 12 with references), considered the interpretation of concepts to be necessary and justified also when applying individual criminal characteristics, provided that the result is in accordance with the purpose of the protection sought by the threat of punishment, as reflected in the characteristics, and that the end result is reasonably foreseeable by the perpetrator. The European Court of Human Rights has also highlighted in its case law the necessity of interpreting provisions, imposed a requirement for an acceptable interpretation of the same content to be foreseeable at the time of the act and required that the outcome be consistent with the essence of the crime in question (e.g. CR v. Great Britain 22.11.1995, paragraph 34, Jorgic v. Germany 12.7.2007, paragraph 101 and Huhtamäki v. Finland 6.3.2012, paragraphs 44-45).

12. Case law has also held (KKO 2018:49, paragraph 20) that, when examining what has been the possibility for individuals and entities to reasonably foresee the interpretation of the regulation in each case, it is justified to take into account the position of the individuals and entities to whom the regulation is addressed. A law may, as is apparent from the case law of the Court of Human Rights, satisfy the requirements of foreseeability even if the person to whom it is addressed has to obtain legal assistance in order to assess the consequences to which an action may lead. A person engaged in a professional or commercial activity involving risks may be expected to do more in this respect than the average person (Cantoni v. France, 11 November 1996, paragraph 35).

13. In its judgment of 28 March 2017 in Rosneft (C-72/15, EU:C:2017:236), the Court of Justice considered the relationship between the principle of legality in criminal law and certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, which were still subject to an interpretation by the Court of Justice at that time and which were alleged to be unclear. The Court of Justice stated (paragraphs 162 and 164) that the principle of legality requires that the offences and the penalties imposed thereon be clearly defined by law. That condition is satisfied when an individual can know, from the wording of the provision or rule in question and, where appropriate, the interpretation given to it by the courts, which acts or omissions will give rise to his criminal liability. Since legislative measures are necessarily general in nature, their wording cannot be absolutely precise. It follows, inter alia, that, although the use of a legislative technique which relies on general categories rather than exhaustive lists often leaves grey areas at the boundaries of the definition, these ambiguities concerning borderline cases cannot, however, in themselves lead to a provision being incompatible with the principle of legality in criminal law, provided that it proves to be sufficiently clear in the majority of cases.

14. Furthermore, according to the Court of Justice (Rosneft, cited above, paragraphs 166-167), it is not contrary to the foreseeability of the law that a person must use informed counsel to assess the possible consequences of a given act to a reasonable extent in the circumstances of the case. Nor does the principle of legality in criminal law prevent the progressive clarification of rules by interpretations in case-law, provided that those rules are reasonably foreseeable. In that case, the Court of Justice considered that the provisions of Regulation 833/2014, which were allegedly unclear, were compatible with the principle of legality in criminal law and held that the principles of legal certainty and nulla poena sine lege certa do not prevent a Member State from imposing criminal penalties on the basis of Article 8(1) of Regulation 833/2014, which are to be applied in the event of infringement of the provisions of that regulation, until the Court of Justice has clarified the scope of those provisions and, consequently, of the criminal penalties attached to them (paragraphs 169-170).

Evaluation and conclusions

15. The Supreme Court notes that the regulatory framework of Article 5i of Regulation 833/2014 clearly states a comprehensive prohibition on exporting euro area banknotes to Russia, although limited exceptions are provided for. The interpretation that the exception provision in paragraph 2(a) of the article covers only personal needs related to travel to Russia is reasonably foreseeable, especially considering the expression “natural persons travelling to Russia or their family members travelling with them” that is directly linked to the expression “personal use” in the provision. In its abovementioned judgment in ZZ v Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main, the Court of Justice also held, with reference to that expression, that it follows from the literal interpretation of Article 5i(2)(a) that the prohibition in paragraph 1 does not apply to the sale, supply, transfer or export by a person travelling to Russia of cash in euros which he needs to acquire goods or services which meet his needs and those of his close relatives who may be travelling with him during his journey to and stay in Russia (paragraphs 25-26).

16. As regards the requirement of foreseeability, importance can also be given to the position of the persons and entities to whom the regulation applies, as is evident from the case law mentioned above. Due to the high visibility of the sanctions against Russia, it is reasonable to require persons intending to cross the border between the Union and Russia to clarify the essential content of the regulation. In addition, in April 2022, the Commission of the European Union issued a non-legally binding interpretative position on the interpretation of the provision in question, according to which the exceptional provision concerns the personal needs of persons travelling to Russia and their family members travelling with them during the journey (Commission consolidated FAQs on the implementation of Council Regulation No 833/2014 and Council Regulation 269/2014). The Court of Justice of the European Union has subsequently substantively confirmed this interpretation in its judgment explained above. Information on the export restrictions in force at any given time has also been comprehensively available on the Customs website.

17. A has not claimed to have sought to clarify the interpretation of the provision. Instead, his conduct, in which he carried a significant amount of banknotes in the inside pocket of his jacket and failed to make a customs declaration, suggests that he actually anticipated that his conduct would be prohibited.

18. When the interpretation of Article 5i(2)(a) of Regulation 833/2014 has been reasonably foreseeable by the perpetrator on the grounds mentioned above and when it is also consistent with the purpose of the protection sought by the threat of punishment as reflected in the characteristics, the principle of legality in criminal law does not prevent A from being held responsible for the regulatory offence.

Prohibition error

19. A has also considered that he should in any case be deemed exempt from criminal liability pursuant to Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, because he has lacked the opportunity to obtain certain information about the correct interpretation of Article 5i of Regulation 833/2014.

20. According to Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, if the perpetrator mistakenly considers his act to be permissible, he is exempt from criminal liability if the mistake must be considered obviously excusable due to the following circumstances: 1) incomplete or incorrect publication of the law; 2) the content of the law being particularly difficult to understand; 3) incorrect advice from an authority; or 4) another comparable circumstance.

21. The Supreme Court, referring to what has been said earlier, states that A has not even attempted to seek information about the content of the export ban (see also, for example, KKO 2015:66, paragraph 39 and KKO 2023:35, paragraph 34) and that his conduct in transporting the money rather suggests that the conduct was prohibited. There is no justification for considering the relevant provision to be particularly obscure. Taking these factors into account, there is no reason to exempt A from criminal liability under Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Criminal Code.

Conclusion

22. On the above grounds, there is no reason to change the outcome of the Court of Appeal's judgment.
